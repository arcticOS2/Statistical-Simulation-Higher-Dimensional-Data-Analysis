## Key Topics & Contributions  

### 1. Monte Carlo Simulation of *e* and *œÄ*  
- Estimated **Euler‚Äôs number (e)** using:
  - (n+1)-sided dice rolls  
  - Factorial-based random permutations  
  - Geometric probability & integration methods  
  - Monte Carlo summation (uniform randoms)  
- Estimated **œÄ** via **high-dimensional sphere volume approximation**.  
- Validated randomness with the **Runs Test**.  

### 2. Normality & Distributional Analysis  
- Normalized large **sunspot dataset** and tested normality with:  
  - **Shapiro‚ÄìWilk, Kolmogorov‚ÄìSmirnov, and Cram√©r‚Äìvon Mises tests**.  
- Complementary visual checks: **Q‚ÄìQ plots, boxplots, histograms**.  
- Findings: dataset deviates from perfect normality (skewness, heavy tails).  

### 3. Regression & Robustness  
- Compared **Least Absolute Deviations (LAD)** vs. **Least Squares Estimator (LSE)**.  
- Evaluated robustness under outliers using error metrics and fitted regression curves.  

### 4. Contour Plots & Mode Detection  
- Generated **contour density plots** for:  
  - Simulated unimodal and bimodal distributions.  
  - Real-world datasets (students‚Äô performance, stellar properties).  
  - Image-based color distributions (HSV space).  
- Used **Kernel Density Estimation (KDE)** for unimodal vs. bimodal detection.  

### 5. Copula-Based Integration  
- Applied **copula theory** to compute multivariate integrals.  
- Monte Carlo convergence analysis with varying dimensions (n) and sample sizes (N).  

### 6. Parallel Computing & High-Dimensional Simulation  
- Designed a **parallel simulation framework in R** using `foreach` + `doParallel`.  
- Generated **10¬π¬π+ standard normal variates** with chunking (10‚Å∑ per core).  
- Achieved:  
  - Scalable performance (speedup ‚âà 6.5√ó on 8 cores).  
  - Memory efficiency (streaming sums & variances only).  
  - Verified global mean ‚âà 0, variance ‚âà 1.
